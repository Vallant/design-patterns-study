\chapter{Abstract and Expose√©}

 There are many many different approaches to achieve good software design, however often it is not clear whether the benefits of the best practices overweight the additional effort of implementing them. Little research is done on comparisons between the designs in terms of efficiency and programming effort. Many books do show sample code of their proposed designs, however they do not cover how the code would look like if implemented in a more straight-forward and monolithic way.

This bachelor's thesis tries to cover this topic by implementing the same application two times: as a monolithic program and as a program that pays attention to the information provided about software design and architecture. In the first step, the program will use only one data source and one graphical interface (GUI). In the second step in each program another data source and GUI was added. 

The sourcecode will be available on Github \footnote{\href{https://github.com/Vallant/design-patterns-study.git}{https://github.com/Vallant/design-patterns-study.git}} under GPLv3 \footnote{\href{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.de.html}{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.de.html}}. The application will be written in Java using Swing as a front-end and PostgreSQL as database. In phase two JavaFX should be supported as a front-end, XML should be supported as a database. The user will be able to choose between all options using parameters when starting the application.
